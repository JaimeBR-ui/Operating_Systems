## Shell
This directory has a custom shell written in C++ that can traverse the filesystem as well as run multiple binaries by calling operating system processes. More details on some of the commands are available within the directory.

This directory contains the several steps to solving the Santa's syncronization problem. The first few steps contain race contidions due to the requirements of not using any syncronization methods. Step 4 we start using semaphores to get rid or race conditions.
