# Operating Systems
This repository contains the projects or assignments for the Operating Systems class. This is meant to be a private repository. If you have access to it please let me know so that I can make it private. Please do not look at or use this code.

## Shell
This directory has a custom shell written in C++ that can traverse the filesystem as well as run multiple binaries by calling operating system processes. More details on some of the commands are available within the directory.

## Synchronization
This directory contains the several steps to solving the Santa's syncronization problem. The first few steps contain race contidions due to the requirements of not using any syncronization methods. Step 4 we start using semaphores to get rid or race conditions.

## newShell 
This is a continuation of the original Shell that improves upon it by increasing functionality when it comes to manipulating data. This newShell also takes a step forward in platforms by being able to run in modern server Linux distributions.
